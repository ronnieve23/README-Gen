## Description
This Repository contains refactored code for Rutgers Coding Bootcamp's Challenge 9 "Professional README Generator". You can check out the original code here! 

https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma


For this This week's challenge, we were tasked to refactor code from the repository above so that it will be a functional README Generator that anyone can use to generate a README file for their repositories.

The app utilizes Node.js and the Inquirer package.

## Installation
1. Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. Clone the repository OR download the code from https://github.com/ronnieve23/readme-gen

3. Navigate to where you saved the downloaded/cloned repository; Right click on the repostiory folder (README-Gen) and select "New Terminal at folder". *(see installation notes)*

4. Inside the terminal, type "npm install Inquirer" and hit enter. Wait for the installation to finish.

5. Type "node index.js" and hit enter. You will be asked to answer a series of prompts; each answer will go towards your generated README file! You should see the message "README Generated" after all the prompts are answered.

6. Close the terminal and open your README-Gen folder. From there, open the "dist" folder and you can find your newly generated README file inside! You can open this file inside VS Code or any code editor that you prefer.

#### Installation Notes:
 1. If you have a windows machine, you can use download and use "GitBash" to simulate usage of the MacOS terminal.

 2. For more experienced developers, you can go ahead and just open the downloaded repository inside VS Code or whichever code editor your are using and invoke the terminal codes from there.
